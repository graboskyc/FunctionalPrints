# My Wallet

This is a remix of [TRIX Minimal Wallet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6321720) but I wanted to make it even more minimal, closer to the [Elephant Wallet Model N](https://elephantwallet.com/collections/n-x-wallets) that I have been carrying for years.

The changes are:
* Only use the one file from the above repo
* Filled in the screw holes
* Widened the strip for elastic band to the size to handle the band used by Elephant Wallets
* Put a hidden circle under the band to fit a coin for a payphone or [other item](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/products/concealed-handcuff-key-coin)
* Stretched the X and Y dimensions so it can fit standard business cards in addition to credit card
* Put my initials in the corner
